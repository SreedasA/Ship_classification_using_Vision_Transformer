# Ship_classification_using_Vision_Transformer
In this project, my primary objective was to achieve high accuracy in automatically categorizing ship images into predefined classes. We leveraged Vision Transformers (ViTs), and adapted them for computer vision tasks. Our focus was on improving accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.
